                <h1>We want to emphasize education, empowerment, and collaboration.</p>
                <p2>Colorado has recently been experiencing a large influx of immigrants, most of whom don't have the same opportunities as those around them. <br>  <br> This especially applies to children, who haven't had access to the education that they deserve. <br> <br> This can be seen in CMAS test scores, a Colorado standardized test presented and summarized by the Colorado Department of Education. <br> <br> On a scale of 650 to 850, the 2018 state-wide average CMAS math scores for non-migrant students grades 3-8 was 734.17, but the average scores of migrant students (everything else constant) was 711.33. <br> <br> After calculating some averages from the same data, an impressive 89.86% of migrants do not meet the benchmark for their respective grades, while 66.54% of everyone else doesn't meet the benchmark. While both averages present unfortunate results, the average for migrants is severely worse. <br> <br> This difference in the availability of education has caused us to act upon this, and subsequently we have been attempting to start a charity that helps with this. <br>  <br> Anna, Deeksha, and Sophia, who are all enrolled in advanced computer science and math courses at our high school, <br> <br> are attempting to tutor these underprivileged children in STEM at immigration centers around Denver. Because transportation and safety pose issues, we plan to use technology in order to tutor these children online through zoom or a similar platform. <br> <br> We are currently in the process of reaching out to centers about this idea, and we are planning on expanding to accept more volunteer tutors once the charity becomes functional.</p>
                <p3>Created by Cherry Creek High School students Sophia White, Anna Kislenkova, and Deeksha Amarala, STEMpact is a tutoring charity organization in which has a mission to serve Title 1 Elementary Schools with tutoring in STEM subjects.</p>
